# Multimodal-transfer-learning-on-fake-news-detection

- Proposed a hybrid transfer learning model that utilizing multimodal features extracted from unstructured text and visual data for
fake news detection.
- Implemented CNN model and applied transfer learning to classify fake news images.
- Fine-tuned model patch blocks in CNN model to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain.
